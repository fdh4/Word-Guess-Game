# Word-Guess-Game
Hw 3 for UCR CBC - Word Guess Game
This is a student exercise consisting of constructing a game app and pushing it to a newly created repo.

The app randomly picks a letter, and then asks the user to guess which letter the app chose. 
The app is quite basic.

The app displays the following text: (description in parentheses)


Guess what letter Iâ€™m thinking of . . . type the letter on the keyboard
Wins:
     (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses:
     (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
     Guesses Left: 
(# of guesses left. This will update)
Your Guesses So Far: 
     (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)


When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

And that is it.  Pretty basic.
